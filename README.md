This repository contains PHP code and samples for accessing the Gardena Smart API in a quite simple way, e.g. for your home automation solution.

#Usage
You basically only need 3 files:
- gardena.class.inc.php (the main file)
- data.inc.php (see the sample file)
- index.php (modify it for your needs)
